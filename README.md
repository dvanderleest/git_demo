# Purpose of this git_demo Repository

NOTE: MOST OF THE TEXT ON THIS PAGE WAS AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED USING BING COPILOT

This `git_demo` repository serves as a practical playground for learning Git concepts. It covers branching, rebasing, and merging. Feel free to experiment, create branches, commit changes, and explore Gitâ€™s power!

Remember, Git is your trusty companion in version control, helping you collaborate, track changes, and manage your code effectively. Happy coding! ðŸš€

## What Is Git?

Git is a powerful distributed version control system (VCS) that allows developers to manage their code efficiently. Here are some key points about Git:

1. Snapshots, Not Differences:

    - Unlike other VCSs (such as CVS or Subversion), Git thinks of its data as a series of snapshots.
    - Every time you commit (save the state of your project), Git captures a picture of all your files at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.
    - If files havenâ€™t changed, Git doesnâ€™t store them again; it links to the previous identical version.

2. Local Operations:

    - Git operates primarily with local files and resources.
    - You have the entire project history on your local disk, making most operations lightning-fast.
    - Browsing project history, viewing changes, and comparing versions happen instantly.

3. Branching:

    - Git allows you to create branches, which are independent lines of development.
    - Branches help you work on features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main project.
    - You can merge branches back together when ready.

4. Rebase and Merging:

    - Rebasing allows you to incorporate changes from one branch into another.
    - Merging combines changes from different branches.
    - Both techniques help maintain a clean and organized project history.
